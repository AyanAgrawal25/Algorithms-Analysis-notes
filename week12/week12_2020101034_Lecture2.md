### Lecture 18 : Shor's Algorithm

#### Problems for the class :

We discussed about the Shor's algorithm which shows that a quantum computer could be used to factor a number $n$ in polynomial time, thus effectively breaking RSA.

### An efficient Quantum Algorithm for Integer Factorization :

We have already studied FFT where we learnt how to factorise a number. Here we will discuss a quantum algorithm to do the same.

#### Step 1 : Factoring and finding a nontrivial square root of $1 \% N$. 

**Lemma:** *If $x$ is a non-trivial square root of $1 \% N$, then $gcd(N,x+1)$ is a non-trivial factor.* 

<u>Proof</u> : 

Since, $x^2 \% N = 1 \implies x^2-1$ is multiple of $N$. 

$\implies (x+1)(x-1) ≡ 0 \% N$, but since $x$ is a non-trivial sqrt of $1 \% N$. 

$\implies x \neq  ±1 mod N$ 

$\therefore$ $N$ must have a non-trivial factor common with $x-1,x+1$. These factors can be given by $gcd(N,x+1)$ and $gcd(N,x-1)$. Though, for the reduction to go through, we only need one of these, say $x+1$.

#### Step 2 : Reducing non-trivial square root of 1 to computing the order mod N

Order of a number $x$ is defined as the smallest positive number $k$ such that $x^k \% N = 1$. 

#### Step 3 : The order of an integer is precisely the period of a particular periodic superposition.

First, we need to find a periodic function $f(a)$ whose period is equal to the degree of $x$, $f(a) = x^a (\% N)$. This function is periodic with a period of $r$, r is the degree of $x$. 

Quantum superpositions that are periodically different from 0 can be established only if the period is an integer same as the period of the function for all periodic functions.

#### Step 4 : Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT)

In polynomial time complexity, a quantum computer may apply the unitarised fourier transform matrix of a state vector :

Now, If $\beta$ is the fourier transform of $\alpha$, such that $|\beta> = (\beta_0,\beta_1....\beta_{M-1})$, then

Now if $s$ independent samples are drawn uniformly from $0, M/k, 2M/k, ..., (k-1)M/k$, then the G.C.D of these samples is $M/k$ with probability of atleast $1-k/2^s$. 

In an efficient QFT, we take help of FFT. In FFT, we found the factors in $O(nlog(n))$. To find the factors in $O(logn)$, we superimpose the 2 DFT steps and do a H-transform on the last bit. Then we apply some unitary transformations and shift by $ω^j$ by using a unitary matrix. Finally, in $O(log^2M)$ quantum operations, we can perform the QFT.

#### Complete Code : 

- **Input : an odd composite number N**
  **Output : a factor of N**

1. First we randomly choose a number $x$, such that $x \in [1,N).$ 

2. Let $M$ be a power of $2$ near $N$. 

3. Repeat this step $t = 2\cross log(N)$ times:

After completing given step, take $g = gcd(j_1,j_2,j_3,....j_t)$ where $j_i$ is the index obtained in the $i^{th}$ iteration of above step.

4. If $M/g$ is even, we compute $gcd(N, x^{M/2g} + 1)$ and output it if it is a non-trivial factor of $N$, else we start again.
